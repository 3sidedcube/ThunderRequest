/// Authenticator is a protocol which is used by `RequestController` to generate and re-authenticate credential objects
///
/// To perform the initial authentication call your own `authenticateWithCompletion` implementation
/// and then save the credential object which you would otherwise return
/// in the completion block to the keychain using `RequestCredential.store(credential:withIdentifier)`.
/// Once you have stored the credential in the keychain all requests will check that it hasn't expired
/// before making the request.
///
/// Setting the `RequestController`'s `sharedRequestCredential` using `set(sharedRequestCredentials:savingToKeychain:)`
/// with savingToKeychain as true will also achieve the same affect.

    /// been saved to the keychain under the provided value from `self.authIdentifier`

    ///   - completion: The completion block which should be called when the user's credential has been refreshed
